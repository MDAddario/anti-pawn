# Anti-pawn

Implementation of minimax algorithm on an original game design.

# What is anti-pawn?

Anti-pawn has a very simple goal: get one of your anti-pawns to the other side and you win!

# What are the rules?

Here is where the name comes from. Each player takes their turn moving one anti-pawn. They can either move them diagonally forward by one square to an unoccupied square, or they can capture an opposing piece if it is directly in front of their piece (the opposite to a standard pawn from chess). There is no double move when moving from the starting position, and the only goal is to get one of your pawns to reach the final rank. Should a player have no moves available to them, they lose.

# Why create this?

The whole purpose of the project is to develop a minimax algorithm. I therefore needed a simple game to practice on.
